# This is Data_mining project - Clustering for Targeted Marketing Campaigns
**Project Summary**
The purpose of this project is to create group customers for a store to have targeted marketing campaigns, using data retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis .
We have used Cluster Analysis, Hierarchical Dendrograms, and K-means Clustering models to categorize the customers into groups. Dropping ‘Recency’ variable to reduce the number of variable columns which have little to no impact on the model efficiency. Customers are uniformly distributed across income ranges and each range has a group of around 224 customers.
This project can be utilized in supermarkets, corporates, and every organization to carry on targeted marketing practices. a clustering algorithm can discover groups of objects where the average distances between the members/data points of each cluster are closer than to members/data points in other clusters.
